<h1>The Best Movies According To Yahya Masood</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time are the following:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>This is my number one movie, mostly because of all the details they put into every character and their backstory. Its a very funny movie as well and always brings a smile to my face.</p>
<h3>Red Notice</h3>
<p>Has got two of my favourite actors, Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds and them working together is absolutely hilarious.</p>
<h3>Fast 5</h3>
<p>Love this movie mainly because im a fan of the whole series and cars in general.</p>
